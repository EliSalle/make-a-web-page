  <h3>Lesson 1: The Web and HTML</h3>
  <p>
  <em>Elements and Tags</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    Tags are opening or closing entities alone. Elements are entire phrases including opening tag, content, and closing tag.
  </p>
  <em>Types of Elements</em>
  <p>
    There are block elements and inline elements. Block elements make a "box" around the content and are recognizable because there is always one tag at the beginning of the content and one at the end. Inline elements, though, do not have a content; they are therefore called void elements.
  </p>
  <em>Why Computers are Stupid</em>
  <p>
  One could say that computers are stupid, as they interpret instructions literally. This makes them very difficult to use since a minor spelling mistake by a programmer can cause big problems in a program.

    <h3>Lesson 2: Creating a Structured Document with HTML</h3>    
      <p>
        <em>The tree structure of HTML</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML
        elements can have other elements inside of them. It therefore somewhat resembles a tree (hence the name <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_structure">tree structure</a>)
. Each box leads to another box, which leads to another box, which leads to yet another box, like a tree trunk leads to a bough, which leads to a branch, which leads to a twig, which leads to a leaf. 
        
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The connection between indented HTML and branches</em>
      </p>
      <p>
       A wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side
        of the document is visible when you read an HTML document as text. The more indented an element is, the more
        deeply embedded its corresponding "branch" is. In the example above, an element which is very deeply indented would be the leaf, right at the end of the tree.
      </p>  
      <p>
        <em>Text Editors (for programming)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Programmers make their life easier by using programs like Scratchpad, Sublime Text, or Codepen, which are special text editors. Many of them save work by automatically generating closing HTML tags.
      </p>

    <h3>Lesson 3: CSS and HTML combined</h3>
  <p>
  <em>CSS</em>
  </p>
    <p>
      CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and it is a way to make webpages look interesting and colorful. Using it, one can give similar HTML elements a class name and then telling the computer to give a certain style to that particular class.
    </p>
    <em>Repetition</em>
    <p>
      Repetition is annoying for 2 reasons. <br>
      1. Inconsistency: If you do not assign each part of a webpage a certain class name, then it is easier to make a mistake, resulting in differing styles which look incongruous. <br>
      2. Errors: If you have to type certain pieces of text again and again, you can easily make small spelling mistakes. In text, that does not matter so much, but typing a link wrong can lead to shocking errors.
